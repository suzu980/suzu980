# Welcome to my Profile 
I am Shizu and I do recreational programming as a hobby~

- My Neovim configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/suzu980/neovim-config)

## Currently Working on...
#### My own [Music Visualizer](https://github.com/suzu980/suzu-music-player). 
Will be powered by Raylib, and future plans are to utilize GLSL for visualization to learn about shaders and the C programming language.
